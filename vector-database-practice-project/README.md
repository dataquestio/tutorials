# Vector Database Practice Project

This repository contains the materials for the **Vector Database Practice Project**, a hands-on project focused on building a real knowledge base search system using vector databases, hybrid search, and evaluation techniques.

The full project walkthrough and instructions live here:

This repo is meant to support that guide, not replace it.

## What This Project Covers

In this project, you’ll build a complete search system end to end, including:

- Collecting and inspecting real-world text data
- Chunking documents and generating embeddings
- Storing and querying data in a production vector database
- Combining semantic search with keyword search
- Evaluating search quality and performance
- Documenting technical decisions for a portfolio-ready project

The emphasis is on system design, tradeoffs, and evaluation, not just implementation.

## Who This Project Is For

This project is intended for learners who already understand the basics of embeddings and vector databases and want to practice applying them in a realistic setting.

It’s designed to produce a concrete, explainable system that you can reference in interviews, technical discussions, or portfolio reviews.

# Solution Code

This folder contains the complete working solution for the ETL tutorial.

## Try It Yourself First!

Building the pipeline yourself is where the learning happens. Only refer to this solution if:
- You're completely stuck
- You want to compare your approach
- You've finished and want to see alternatives

## Running the Solution

From the project root:
```bash
# Copy solution files to root
cp solution/src/etl_pipeline.py src/
cp solution/main.py .

# Run it
spark-submit main.py
```

## Key Learning Points

Compare your solution to this one:
- **Error handling**: How do we handle edge cases?
- **Logging**: What information is logged and why?
- **Function organization**: How are responsibilities split?
- **Code clarity**: Is the code readable and maintainable?

There's no "perfect" solution - if your pipeline works and handles the data quality issues, you've succeeded!
